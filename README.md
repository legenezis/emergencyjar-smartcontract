# Cadena PROJECT 1 - Emergency Jar Smart Contract

This contract creates a (sort of) shared wallet.

The idea was to emulate an "emergency jar" in which significant others may occasionally drop in change. The money is pooled there, and both are able to withdraw from the jar -- ie. in case of emergency.

The jar can have multiple owners. Perhaps, the emergency jar is shared within members of a nuclear family (ie. husband, wife, son, daughter).

The jar creator can add and remove owners of the jar. Jar owners, including the jar creator, can deposit or withdraw change. They may also check the jar balance.

Do take a look!
